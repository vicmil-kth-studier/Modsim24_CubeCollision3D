This is a headers only library for helping when writing code

The library only requires the standard library for C++ 11, so it should basically run anywhere

The library should be able to be run on both linux, mac, windows and be compilable with emscripten to run in the browser


Usage:
Just include vicmil_std_lib header into your project, and everything should just work!
