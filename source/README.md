# What does this folder contain?
Here is all the files that contains the physics that drives the project. Since that is the main purpose of the project, this is the most important folder.

## NOTE
The vicmil_lib folder is also a part of the project. It contains code necessary for graphics, testing and debugging etc. So not really part of the physics side
