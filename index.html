            <h2>2 Mars 2024: The project idea</h2>
            <p>
                The basic idea of the project is to implement collisions between cubes in 3D. I would also like to make 
                much of the code reusable for later projects, so I will try to make a library of sorts of help functions
                and classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am planning to write the project in C++ and use OpenGL coupled with SDL for the graphics part. I will also
                rely on a library called GLM for some of the linear algebra and maths involved in the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see an image below of what I am trying to achieve:

            <h2>3 Mars 2024: Running C++ code in the web</h2>
            <p>I thought it would be really cool to be able to interact with my project in the web. That way people don't
                have to download anything. I chose to use C++ for my project, and it turns out that there exists a compiler
                called emscripten that allows you to compile your code into webassemply that can then be run in the web.
            </p>
            <p> I created some simple hello world program and compiled it. The result can be found in the link below:</p>

            <h2>4 Mars 2024: Add OpenGL and Cube graphics</h2>
            <p>The project needs to have some way to display the cubes. I had already worked with OpenGL previously, so 
                I just added some code from a previos project and modified it a bit. I also made sure to add a custom
                logging and testing library that I had developed to make future development easier.
