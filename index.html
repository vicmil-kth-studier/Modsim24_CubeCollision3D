            <h2>2 Mars 2024: The project idea</h2>
            <p>
                The basic idea of the project is to implement collisions between cubes in 3D. I would also like to make 
                much of the code reusable for later projects, so I will try to make a library of sorts of help functions
                and classes. I will call it "vicmil lib" for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am planning to write the project in C++ and use OpenGL coupled with SDL for the graphics part. I will also
                rely on a library called GLM for some of the linear algebra and maths involved in the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see an image below of what I am trying to achieve:

            <h2>3 Mars 2024: Running C++ code in the web</h2>
            <p>I thought it would be really cool to be able to interact with my project in the web. That way people don't
                have to download anything. I chose to use C++ for my project, and it turns out that there exists a compiler
                called emscripten that allows you to compile your code into webassemply that can then be run in the web.
            </p>
            <p> I created some simple hello world program and compiled it. The result can be found in the link below:</p>

            <h2>4 Mars 2024: Add OpenGL and Cube graphics</h2>
            <p>The project needs to have some way to display the cubes. I had already worked with OpenGL previously, so 
                I just added some code from a previos project and modified it a bit. I also made sure to add a custom
                logging and testing library that I had developed to make future development easier.

            <h2>11 Mars 2024: Add Impulse Physics</h2>
            <p>We now want to play around with the physics of the project, like applying forces to objects.
                This requires a great deal of maths and physics. Some of these concepts include representing rotation
                in 3D as well as inertia tensors for calculating how forces affects the object. For some of the
                basic maths such as linear algebra, I decided to use a library called glm.

                I created a small simulation where you can see the result of this:

            <h2>12 Mars 2024: Add Collision Physics</h2>
            <p>We now move on to implementing the collision part of the simulation. We can start simple and have a 
                cube collide with the ground plane. This builds on our impulse simulation. To resolve the
                collision requires multiple steps. </p>

                <p>1: determine if the cube is colliding with the ground</p>

                <p>2: separate the cube and the ground(since due to the time steps they might intersect)</p>

                <p>3: calculate the impact position and direction</p>

                <p>4: apply the correct impulse magnitude at the contact</p>

            <h2>13 Mars 2024: Create Falling Cubes Simulation </h2>
            <p>For the next part I wanted to complete what we initially set out to do when we started the project; creating falling cubes!
                To do this, we will implement cube-cube collisions. We will also have to handle multiple collisions at the same time, 
                to solve this, we will prioritize the worst collisions first </p>
